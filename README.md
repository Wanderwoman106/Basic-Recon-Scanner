This program should be ran as root user.

Basic scanning & recon tool for gathering some info on a host/domain. 

All you need to input is a Domain, and it will take the work from there!
It will scan for the IP, open ports, protocols, whois info, and also give you the option to put in a custom spoofed MAC address for your scans.

I'm a newbie and it is still a work in progress!
